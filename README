1. Open DYEP.xcodeproj (either by doubleclicking it in Finder, or opening Xcode and importing it)
2. If you’re on Xcode 8 (as of 2017-02-27 the current version is 8.2.1), you need to explicitly tell it not to use Swift 3. Open build settings (click once on the project in the left pane, then Build Settings), search for “legacy swift”, and choose “Yes”. You need to do this for both DYEP and YouTubePlayer.
